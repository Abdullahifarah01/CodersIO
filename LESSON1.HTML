        <p>The Labour Party is a social democratic political party in the United Kingdom that has been described as being an alliance of social democrats, democratic socialists, and trade unionists.[14] The Labour Party sits on the centre-left of the political spectrum. It is the incumbent governing party of the United Kingdom, having won the 2024 general election, and is currently the largest UK political party by the number of votes cast and number of seats in the House of Commons. There have been seven Labour prime ministers and fourteen Labour ministries. The party traditionally holds the annual Labour Party Conference during party conference season, at which senior Labour figures promote party policy.</p>
